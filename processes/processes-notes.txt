Current setup only allows for process to be added to the table.

If a process finishes, i.e., halts, the program will exit since
there is currently no interrupt handler for `IV_HALT`s.

TO-DO:
    - add more interrupt handlers (besides the timer one)
    - IV_HALT should remove a process from the table
    - add a keyboard handler. this should handle input
        for different processes
